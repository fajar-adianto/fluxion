# Fluxion

Fluxion is a modern Qt6 QML library that brings Google’s Material Design 3 to your applications with a clean Flux architecture. Built on top of [QuixFlux](https://github.com/fajar-adianto/quixflux.git), this project aims to provide scalable, maintainable, and visually consistent UI components for QML developers.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 Dynamic Material Color System: Integrated with Google's [Material Color Utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities) for automatic tone mapping and dynamic theming.
- 📐 **Material Design 3 Components**: Sleek, pixel-perfect Material widgets styled for modern UX.
- ⚙️ **Flux Architecture**: Unidirectional data flow for predictable and testable state management.
- ⚡ **Built with Qt6**: Harnesses the latest QML and QtQuick APIs.

## 🚧 Project Status

Fluxion is currently under development.  
Not all Material Design 3 components are implemented yet.

### 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are very welcome!
If you'd like to help implement new components or improve the architecture, please:

* Follow the **Flux architecture** principles (unidirectional data flow)
* Respect the **Material Design Tokens** and naming conventions for consistency
* Refer to existing patterns in the code for guidance

> ⚠️ **Note**:
> Comprehensive documentation of the internal structure and component hierarchy is not yet available.
> However, a key pattern to understand is the **specification mechanism**. This is implemented using C++ classes with the naming format:
>
> ```
> FxXyzSpecification
> ```
>
> * `Xyz` is a placeholder for the element of a Material Design QML Component (e.g., Container, Icon, StateLayer, Text)
> * These are located in files named:
>
>   * `fx_xyz_specification.h`
>   * `fx_xyz_specification.cpp`
>
> These classes define configuration contracts and design tokens used by QML components.

Feel free to explore the codebase and raise a discussion or issue if you need guidance before contributing.
